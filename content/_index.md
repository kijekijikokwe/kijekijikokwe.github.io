**A Dynamic Advocate for Inclusivity, Equity, and Intersectional Rights**

Char's consulting skills run deep, from being self-employed at an age when her peers were still playing with Barbies and G.I. Joe. Char's team of associates supplement her knowledge with Southern Ontario sleuthing skills to Northeastern Ontario knowledge deep in their veins. From program design, to EDI, to Two-Spirit training, disability ability work, workshopping, tutoring, and mentoring: Char and a team who have her back are ready to have you're organization's back too.

Charlotte Hunter, an autistic, trans, Métis, and disabled person, has embarked on a remarkable journey, intertwining the fields of biochemistry, pharmacology, social research, and law. Their story exemplifies resilience, intellectual prowess, and an unwavering commitment to advocacy.

As a proud Two-Spirit Louttit-Kijekijik of the Historic Abitibi Inland Métis Community, Charlotte embraces their gender identity and cultural heritage.

Formally educated in both science and law, and navigating life with multiple disabilities, Charlotte's work predominantly revolves around evidence-based advocacy. Their efforts focus on trans/non-binary rights and equity, addressing homelessness and housing issues for two-spirit and neurodivergent individuals, and exploring the biopsychosocial implications of medicine, law, and climate change on the 2SLGBTQQIA+ community.
